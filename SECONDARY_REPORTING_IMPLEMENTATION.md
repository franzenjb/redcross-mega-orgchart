# Secondary Reporting Lines Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds dotted line connectors to visually distinguish secondary reporting relationships from primary ones in the Red Cross SE & Caribbean Division organization chart.

## Visual Design

### Line Styles
- **Primary Reporting**: Solid lines (#aaa, 1.5px width)
- **Secondary Reporting**: Dotted lines (#999, 1.5px width, 5px dash pattern, 70% opacity)

### Example Structure
```
Anna Trefethen (Division VP)
├── D. Dixon (Chief Development Officer) [solid line]
│   ├─┬─> W. Carney (CDO - Florida N/C) [dotted line - secondary report]
│   ├─┬─> Tzaicel Hernandez (CDO - Florida South) [dotted line]
│   ├─┬─> L. Vaughn (CDO - Tennessee) [dotted line]
│   ├─┬─> D. Warren (CDO - Alabama/Mississippi) [dotted line]
│   ├─┬─> E. Davis (CDO - North Carolina) [dotted line]
│   ├─┬─> S. Ingraham (CDO - South Carolina) [dotted line]
│   └─┬─> M. Santiago (CDO - Puerto Rico) [dotted line]
│
├── C. Smith (Regional Executive - Florida N/C) [solid line]
│   └── W. Carney (CDO - Florida N/C) [solid line - primary report]
│
└── [Other Regional Executives with their CDOs...]
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. CSS Styling (Line ~140 in beta-d3-orgchart.html)
```css
.link-secondary {
    fill: none;
    stroke: #999;
    stroke-width: 1.5;
    stroke-dasharray: 5, 5;  /* Creates dotted line effect */
    opacity: 0.7;
}
```

### 2. Data Source
- Loaded `org-data-unified.js` which contains the `unifiedOrgData` object
- This provides access to the `people` registry with dual reporting metadata
- Each person with `dualReport: true` has both `primaryReport` and `secondaryReport` fields

### 3. Core Function: `drawSecondaryReportingLines()`

**Location**: After line ~1033 in beta-d3-orgchart.html

**Purpose**: Draws dotted SVG paths to represent secondary reporting relationships

**Logic Flow**:
1. Only activates when viewing 'division' or 'all' regions
2. Checks for `unifiedOrgData` availability
3. Gets SVG element and chart nodes
4. Builds a map of person names to their rendered positions
5. Finds all dual reporting relationships
6. Draws stepped dotted paths between secondary managers and their reports

**Path Drawing Algorithm**:
```javascript
// Start at bottom center of manager node
const x1 = fromNode.x;
const y1 = fromNode.y + fromNode.height / 2;

// End at top center of report node
const x2 = toNode.x;
const y2 = toNode.y - toNode.height / 2;

// Create stepped path: down, across, down
const midY = (y1 + y2) / 2;
const path = `M ${x1} ${y1} L ${x1} ${midY} L ${x2} ${midY} L ${x2} ${y2}`;
```

### 4. Integration Points

Secondary lines are automatically redrawn:
- After initial chart render (1200ms delay)
- After expandAll operations
- After collapseAll operations  
- After individual node expansion/collapse

## Dual Reporting Relationships

### All 7 Regional CDOs have dual reporting:

| Person | Primary Report | Secondary Report | Region |
|--------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| W. Carney | C. Smith (Regional Exec) | D. Dixon (Division CDO) | Florida N/C |
| Tzaicel Hernandez | Krista Coletti (Regional Exec) | D. Dixon | Florida South |
| L. Vaughn | J. Sullivan (Regional Exec) | D. Dixon | Tennessee |
| D. Warren | M. Beddingfield (Regional Exec) | D. Dixon | Alabama/Mississippi |
| E. Davis | A. Taylor (Regional Exec) | D. Dixon | North Carolina |
| S. Ingraham | Susan Everitt (Regional Exec) | D. Dixon | South Carolina |
| M. Santiago | L. Feliciano (Regional Exec) | D. Dixon | Puerto Rico |

## Files Modified

### beta-d3-orgchart.html
1. Added CSS for `.link-secondary` class
2. Loaded `org-data-unified.js` script
3. Added `drawSecondaryReportingLines()` function
4. Integrated function calls in chart lifecycle

## Testing

### Logic Verification
A test file (`test-secondary-logic.html`) was created to verify:
- ✅ Finding 7 secondary reporting relationships
- ✅ All connections point to D. Dixon
- ✅ Node name matching works correctly
- ✅ SVG path generation produces valid coordinates

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/beta-d3-orgchart.html
2. Select "Division Leadership" from region dropdown
3. Expand Anna Trefethen node
4. Observe dotted lines from D. Dixon to regional CDOs
5. Test expand/collapse - lines should redraw correctly
6. Switch to "All Regions" view - lines should remain visible

## Benefits

1. **Visual Clarity**: Clearly distinguishes functional vs hierarchical reporting
2. **Organizational Understanding**: Shows matrix reporting structure
3. **Professional Appearance**: Maintains clean, corporate aesthetic
4. **Maintainable**: Uses existing data structure, no manual line definitions needed
5. **Automatic**: Lines redraw with chart interactions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Tooltip on hover showing "Secondary Report to [Manager Name]"
- Legend explaining line types
- Toggle to show/hide secondary reporting lines
- Different dash patterns for different types of secondary relationships
- Color coding based on functional area

## Known Limitations

1. Secondary lines only appear in Division Leadership and All Regions views
2. External CDN resources (d3.js, d3-org-chart) must be accessible
3. Lines are redrawn on each chart interaction (minimal performance impact)
4. Node names must match exactly between data sources

## Support

For questions or issues with this implementation, refer to:
- `org-data-unified.js` for dual reporting data structure
- `beta-d3-orgchart.html` lines 133-145 for CSS
- `beta-d3-orgchart.html` lines 1033-1135 for drawing logic
